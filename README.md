# Data Science Interview Prep  
 Interactive notebooks to prepare for data science interviews. These notebooks are free and available for anyone to use!  

Please note that these notebooks are intended to review material rather than teach. The assumption being that you are comfortable coding in Python, familiar with statistics, and understand the data science workflow.  

If you are looking to learn data science, I highly recommend the book *Python Data Science Handbook* by Jake VanderPlas: https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/.
